Subject : Research software engineer - Farooq Zuberi Application

Dear Noreen,


I hope you are well. I submitted a resume earlier this month for the research engineer position advertised at MPI careers. I want a follow up on my application and would like reiterate my interest in the position. 

I am very interested in working at Max Plank Institute for Intelligent Systems Company and I believe my skills, specially the experience gained during the Master's Degree at University og Freiburg, would be an ideal match for this position. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best Regards,
Farooq Zuberi
